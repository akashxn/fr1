1) What are the top 5 brands by receipts scanned for most recent month?

SELECT Brands.name, count(*) Total
FROM Receipts
RIGHT JOIN rewardsReceiptItemList
 ON Receipt._id = rewardsReceiptItemList._id
LEFT JOIN Brands

WHERE month(Receipts.createDate) = month(now())
AND
year(Receipts.createDate) = year(now())
GROUP BY Brands.name
ORDER BY Total DESC
LIMIT 5;

==========================================================

2) How does the ranking of the top 5 brands by receipts scanned for the recent month compare to the ranking for the previous month?

SELECT * FROM
(
SELECT Brands.name, month(Receipt.createDate)
       RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY month(Receipt.createDate) ORDER BY count(*) DESC) Rank
FROM Receipts
RIGHT JOIN rewardsReceiptItemList
 ON Receipt._id = rewardsReceiptItemList._id
LEFT JOIN Brands
 ON Brands.barcode = rewardsReceiptItemList.barcode
WHERE (month(Receipts.createDate) = month(now()) AND year(Receipts.createDate) = year(now())) OR 
(month(Receipts.createDate) = month(now())-1 AND year(Receipts.createDate) = year(now())-1)
) a

WHERE a.Rank <=  5;


==========================================================

3) When considering average spend from receipts with 'rewardsReceiptStatus’ of ‘Accepted’ or ‘Rejected’, which is greater?

SELECT AVG(totalSpent) AS avgSpend

==========================================================

4) When considering total number of items purchased from receipts with 'rewardsReceiptStatus’ of ‘Accepted’ or ‘Rejected’, which is greater?

SELECT SUM(purchasedItemCount) AS totalItemsPurchased

LIMIT 1;
